- [ ] Optional file logging

### 7. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for each module
- [ ] Integration tests for fallback chain
- [ ] Mock ElevenLabs API for testing
- [ ] Test error scenarios:
  - [ ] Missing API key
  - [ ] Network failures

### 9. Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Multiple voice profiles
- [ ] Custom message templates
- [ ] Notification history
- [ ] Web UI for configuration
- [ ] Support for other TTS providers
- [ ] Cross-platform support (Linux native audio)

### 10. Concurrent Notification Handling (Future Enhancement)
**Alternative approaches for preventing simultaneous voice notifications:**

#### Queue System Approach:
- Implement a notification daemon that manages a queue
- Each notification request adds to the queue instead of playing immediately
- Daemon processes queue sequentially, ensuring only one plays at a time
- Benefits: No missed notifications, controlled playback order
- Drawbacks: More complex architecture, requires daemon process

#### Cooldown Period Approach:
- Implement a time-based cooldown after each notification
- Ignore or defer notifications within X seconds of the last one
- Could be configurable (e.g., 2-5 second cooldown)
- Benefits: Simple to implement, prevents rapid-fire notifications
- Drawbacks: Might miss important notifications during cooldown

### 11. Audio Ducking / Music App Control (Future Enhancement)
**Research completed on music app control during playback:**

#### Findings:
- System volume ducking affects ALL audio (including the notification) - not viable
- Apple Music supports AppleScript volume control: `set sound volume to 20`
- Spotify supports AppleScript volume control (when running)
- Amperfy only supports pause/play via UI automation, not volume control

#### Implementation Options:
1. **App-specific pause/resume (works for Amperfy)**
   ```bash
   # Pause
   mac osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "Amperfy" to click menu item "Pause" of menu "Controls" of menu bar 1'
   # Resume
   mac osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "Amperfy" to click menu item "Play" of menu "Controls" of menu bar 1'
   ```

2. **App-specific volume control (Apple Music/Spotify)**
   ```bash
   # Lower volume
   mac osascript -e 'tell application "Music" to set sound volume to 20'
   # Restore volume
   mac osascript -e 'tell application "Music" to set sound volume to 100'
   ```

3. **Virtual audio driver approach**
   - Use tools like BackgroundMusic for per-app volume control
   - Requires system-level audio driver installation

#### Recommended Approach:
- Detect running music apps
- Use volume control for Apple Music/Spotify
- Use pause/resume for Amperfy and unsupported apps
- Make it configurable (some users may prefer pause vs duck)
